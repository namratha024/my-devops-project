## Branching Workflow
- `main` → contains stable, production-ready code.
- `dev` → development branch for integrating feature branches.
- `feature/*` → individual feature branches (e.g., `feature/add-logging`).

**Workflow:**
1. Create a feature branch from `dev`.
2. Make changes, commit, and push.
3. Open a Pull Request from feature → `dev`.
4. Merge feature branch into `dev`.
5. Merge `dev` into `main` when stable.
6. Tag releases as needed.

## Features Implemented
- Basic Python app (`app.py`) with logging print statements.
- Version control using Git & GitHub.
- Documentation of project tasks (`TASKS.md`).
- Branching and pull request workflow.
